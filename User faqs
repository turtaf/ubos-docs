q) what happens if I get an error installing a new site on a fresh install?
a) This could be due to an update of the files on our servers, try ubos-admin update first and follow any instruction that might come. Then try again.

q) can I ssh into my ubos machine?
a) of course you can, you just need to access once physically and setting a root password with the passwd command.

q) Iâ€™m creating a new site with ubos-admin createsite, why am I asked to give it a domain name? Do I need to set up a name server?

q) Hey cool it looks like I just installed a site! Now how can I access (via web) the site I created on ubos from my LAN? is there any special ip? how do I find it?

q) Is it safe to have my site accessible from the public web?
